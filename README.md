i dont plan on updating infclimbdev.html ever because it was just some stupid project i made while i was bored in school, but the regular infclimb.html might get updates if anybody notices a bug.

https://www.roblox.com/games/127290608921408/Infinite-Climb is the roblox version, yes, i made it in roblox. pc only right now, might allow mobile/console players to play soon.

the mobile port will not be on the google play store any time soon as i cant spare 25 bucks for a dev account with google, and ill never upload it on ios bc 100 bucks a year is stupid.
